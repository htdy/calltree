     calltree -	static call tree generator for C programs

     The calltree command parses  a  collection	 of  input  files
     (assuming	C  syntax) and builds a	graph that represents the
     static call structure of these files.

     Calltree  is  similar  to	cflow(1)  but  unlike	cflow(1),
     calltree  is not based on lint(1).	 Calltree implements some
     more functions than cflow(1), but does not	list  the  return
     types of the functions. This is because calltree includes an
     own C parser and thus may be used even on systems that don't
     have lint(1).  The	disadvantage is	that the C parser that is
     used by calltree is not completely	correct	and may	not  find
     all  calls	of a function. This is mainly true for calls that
     are done via function pointers.

     Calltree is able to detect	recursive  function  calls  (e.g.
     functions	that  call themselves).	 Recursive function calls
     are marked	with an	ellipsis in the	output.
